# Ch. 18

# The Romans Struggles

Sed Vespasianus[^1] Romanos his excursibus male affectos aspiciens (nam et terga[^2] dare Judaeis pudebat[^3], et fugientes[^4] insequi armorum pondere[^5] tardabantur : cum[^6] Judaei semper aliquid agentes, priusquam paterentur, in civitatem refugerent) armatis imperat[^7], ut eorum impetum declinarent, neve[^8] cum[^9] hominibus mortis avidis manum consererent. Nihil[^10] esse fortius desperatis. Restingui[^11] autem illorum impetus, si proposito frustrentur, quasi[^12] flammam, si materiam non inveniat. Ad hoc oportere[^13] Romanos cautius[^14] quaerere victoriam, augendae[^15] possessionis causa non ex necessitate pugnantes. Per sagittarios autem Arabum[^16] et Syriae et funditores, perque saxa[^17] tormentis emissa plerunque repellebat Judaeos, nulla enim telorum machina quiescebat. Illi[^18] autem his quidem male accepti cedebant : verum[^19] eminus missa intra[^20] iactum subeuntes, saevius Romanis[^21] instabant: cum neque[^22] corpori, neque animae parcerent : sed per[^23] vicem utrinque pugnarent, suorum[^24] quisque laborantibus[^25] subvenientes[^26].


[^1]: *Sed Vespasianus …. aspiciens*: your nominative participle *aspiciens* starts off **indirect statement**, with *affectos* acting as the **infinitive verb** since a form of *sum* often drops out, leaving just the **PPP**  
   
[^2]: *terga dare Judaeis: terga dare* “to flee,”  *Judaeis* is dative  
   
[^3]: *pudebat*: *pudet* is an **impersonal verb,** “it was shameful” (to the Romans)  
   
[^4]: *fugientes insequi ….. tardabantur:* take the Romans as your subject, and the *fugientes* as referring to the Jews when they escape after having destroyed the siege crafts  
   
[^5]: *armorum pondere:* pondus, \-eris (n) is ablative here, NOT an infinitive, *by the weight of the armor*  
   
[^6]: *cum Judaei ….. refugerent*: save the *priusquam paterentur* for last in this phrase. It refers to the Jews taking damage as they were fleeing  
   
[^7]: *imperat*: the verb *impero, imperare* takes a dative, *armatis,* of who is commanded. Then the *ut* starts an **indirect command**  
   
[^8]: *neve*: *or that they not….   ne+ve*  
   
[^9]: *cum hominibus mortis avidis*: *with men greedy/eager for death*  
   
[^10]: *nihil esse fortius desperatis*: the \-*ius* for a 3rd declension adjective can also be the neuter nom/acc, *nothing is stronger than desperate ones*  
   
[^11]: *restingui*: sigh, this is a **historical infinitive**, which means that it acts as your main verb, and is really in the infinitive for no reason at all. It’s popular with historians, hence the name   
   
[^12]: *quasi flammam, si materiam non inveniat*: this is a simile, comparing the Jews without anything to attack to fire without any wood to burn  
   
[^13]: *oportere Romanos*: *oportet* is another **impersonal verb**, and takes an accusative of the person, *it was fitting for the Romans*  

[^14]: *cautius*: note the -*ius*, making this a **comparative adverb**     
   
[^15]: *augendae possessionis causa*:  **gerundive \+** *causa* in the ablative is *for the sake of*  
   
[^16]: *Arabum et Syriae*: reinforcements from other parts of the empire  
   
[^17]: *saxa tormentis emissa*: note that, since *saxum* is neuter, neuter plurals end in \-*a*, this is absolutely not an ablative absolute  
   
[^18]: *Illi autem …. cedebant*: the pronoun, *illi,* shows the change in subject to the Jews  
   
[^19]: *verum*: *but*, just like *vero*  
   
[^20]: *intra iactum*: *within the range,* meaning that the Jews were so close that the siege engines could not fire upon them  
   
[^21]: *Romanis instabant*: compound verbs, like *in*\+*stare*, take a **dative of reference**  
   
[^22]: *neque corpori, neque animae parcerent*: *parco, \-ere* takes a dative  
   
[^23]: *Per vicem*: *in turn*  
   
[^24]: *suorum quisque: each one of them*  
   
[^25]: *Laborantibus*: first, take this as a **substantive participle**. Second, *laboro, \-are* is frequently used as *to struggle* in military contexts, *those struggling*  
   
[^26]: *Subvenientes*: *subvenio* has the idea of *coming up to help*
