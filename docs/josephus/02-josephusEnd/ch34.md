# Ch. 34 English


According to which resolution they marched without noise, at the hour that had been told them, to the wall; and it was Titus himself that first got upon it, with one of his tribunes, Domitius Sabinus, and had a few of the fifteenth legion along with him. So they cut the throats of the watch, and entered the city very quietly. After these came Cerealis the tribune, and Placidus, and led on those that were tinder them. Now when the citadel was taken, and the enemy were in the very midst of the city, and when it was already day, yet was not the taking of the city known by those that held it; for a great many of them were fast asleep, and a great mist, which then by chance fell upon the city, hindered those that got up from distinctly seeing the case they were in, till the whole Roman army was gotten in, and they were raised up only to find the miseries they were under; and as they were slaying, they perceived the city was taken. 

# Title (Ch. 34 continued in Latin)

34. Romanos autem memores quid obsidionis tempore pertulissent, neque parcendi cuiquam, neque miserendi quenquam tangebat cura: sed ex arce plebem ad prona compulsam facillime trucidabant, ubi loci difficultas pugnacibus quoque negaret copiam resistendi. Viarum namque angustiis pressi, ac per declivia dilabentes, fluente desuper bello obterebantur. Id multos etiam qui circa Josephum lecti erant, ut manibus propriis liberarentur incitavit. Nam cum se viderent Romanorum neminem posse occidere, ne Romanorum manibus oppeterent, praevenerunt, et in extrema parte civitatis congregati, semet interfecerunt.
