# Ch. 22

# Vespasian is Injured 

Praeter[^1] hos Josephus quoque et caetera multitudo[^2], raptis ignibus, machinas[^3] et refugia, cum operibus quintae[^4] itemque decimae eius[^5] quae terga[^6] dederat legionis, incendunt. Caeteri autem qui mox consecuti sunt, et instrumenta et omne genus materiae obruerunt[^7]. Rursus[^8] autem Romani sub vesperam erectum arietem ad eam muri partem, quae pridem quassata[^9] fuerat, appulere[^10]: ibique propugnatorum quidam Vespasiani plantam[^11] sagitta percussam leviter vulnerat, quia[^12] vis teli spatio defecisset. Maximam[^13] tunc id Romanis perturbationem fecit. his[^14] enim qui prope aderant viso sanguine perterritis, per omnem fama cucurrit exercitum: relictaque obsidione, plerique[^15] cum stupore atque formidine ad ducem belli concurrebant: et ante omnes Titus[^16] aderat metuens[^17] patri. Unde[^18] contigit, ut et benevolentia circa rectorem[^19], et filii trepidatio[^20] confunderet multitudinem. facile tamen pater[^21] et timore filium, et perturbatione liberavit exercitum. superato[^22] enim dolore vulneris, et[^23] ab omnibus, qui sui causa[^24] pertimuerunt, conspici studens, bellum in Judaeos saevius incitavit. nam[^25] velut ultor quisque imperatoris omne periculum adire cupiebat: et clamore alius[^26] alium adhortantes, murum petebant.



[^1]: *praeter hos:* this refers to the three specific Jews that we focused on in the previous chapter. Josephus zooms in on them, and then zooms back out to wider Jewish actions  
   
[^2]: *caetera multitudo:* as we've seen, there are a class of 3rd declension nouns where your nominative ends in \-*o*, like *multitudo, multitudinis* (f), so this is your nominative subject. All of these \-*o* nominatives are feminine, thus *caetera* describes *multitudo*  
   
[^3]: *machinas et refugia:* take these as the direct object of *incendunt* later on  
   
[^4]: *quintae itemque decimae…legionis:*  translate these together as one genitive group; “of the fifth and likewise the tenth legions”  
 
[^5]: *eius:* I’ve got no idea why this is here, so ignore it, I suppose \*shrug\*  
   
[^6]: *terga dederat*: literally “give their backs”; translate as “retreat” because when you retreat you are turning your back to the enemy  
 
[^7]: *obruerunt:* *obruo, obruere* \- “to bury,” this is done to render the siege weapons unusable  
  
[^8]: *rursus:* can be translated as “back,” but go with “again” here, since the Romans are taking up the *aries*, the battering ram, again  
   
[^9]: *quassata fuerat*; *fuerat* is pluperfect from *sum, esse, fui, futurus,* making this a **PPP \+ a form of sum**  
   
[^10]: *appulere:* this is a **Fake Infinitive**, which looks like the infinitive at firs glance, but is slightly different from the actual infinitive of *appello* which is *appellere*. Translate **Fake Infinitives** as the 3rd person plural perfect, or “they have driven”  
   
[^11]: *plantam: planta, \-ae* is “heel”  
   
[^12]: *quia vis teli spatio defecisset*: *since the force of the weapon was lacking due to the space. spatio* is **ablative of cause**  
   
[^13]: *Maximam tunc id Romanis perturbationem fecit*: *id* is your subject, referring to the fact that Vespasian was struck by the arrow  
   
[^14]: *his…perterritis:* this is one big **Ablative Absolute** phrase with another Ablative Absolute, *viso sanguine*, inside of it.  
   
[^15]: *plerique:* this is a **Substantive Adjective**, or an adjective that acts as a noun, so take this as your subject  
   
[^16]: *Titus:* [Titus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titus) is the elder son, and favorite child, of Vespasian. He is present with him during the Jewish War, and takes over command of the [Siege of Jerusalem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Jerusalem_\(70_CE\)) when Vespasian goes back to Rome during the [Year of the Four Emperors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_of_the_Four_Emperors). He later becomes emperor, but has a brief, yet productive reign  
   
[^17]: *metuens patri:* because *patri* is dative, take this as “fearing *for* the father”, not as if it were accusative, “fearing *the father*”  
 
[^18]: *Unde contigit ut….:* *contigit* – *it happened*; the *ut* starts off a **substantive noun clause**, which just means that the phrase that follows is the subject of *it happened*, namely, what happened 
   
[^19]: *rectorem: rector, rectoris* (m) \- “leader”  
   
[^20]: *trepidatio filii: trepidatio, trepidationis* (f) is another one of those \-o nominative 3rd declensions  
   
[^21]: *pater…exercitum:* this is a classic Greek construction, as we know that this text is a translation of Josephus’ own Greek text. Use the *liberavit* twice, with both the *filium* and *exercitum* as your two direct objects and *timore* and *pertubatione* as two **ablatives of separation**  
   
[^22]: *superato dolore vulneris:* *with the pain of the wound having been overcome,* meaning that Vespasian has recovered, NOT that he has succumbed to the pain of the wound  
   
[^23]: *et…incitavit:* jump down to *bellum*, taking *incitavit* and your main verb; since there is no new subject, take *pater* as your subject  

[^24]: *sui causa: because of him*, *causa* is **ablative of cause** (duh)   
   
[^25]: *nam…cupiebat*: Take in this order: *nam quisque cupiebat adire omne periculum velut ultor imperatoris*.  
   
[^26]: *alius alium*: when you have two *alius* as the subject and *alium* as the direct object, you can just translate as “each other”
