# Ch. 35 English
However, such of the watch as at the first perceived they were taken, and ran away as fast as they could, went up into one of the towers on the north side of the city, and for a while defended themselves there; but as they were encompassed with a multitude of enemies, they tried to use their right hands when it was too late, and at length they cheerfully offered their necks to be cut off by those that stood over them. And the Romans might have boasted that the conclusion of that siege was without blood [on their side] if there had not been a centurion, Antonius, who was slain at the taking of the city. His death was occasioned by the following treachery; for there was one of those that were fled into the caverns, which were a great number, who desired that this Antonius would reach him his right hand for his security, and would assure him that he would preserve him, and give him his assistance in getting up out of the cavern; accordingly, he incautiously reached him his right hand, when the other man prevented him, and stabbed him under his loins with a spear, and killed him immediately.

# Title (Ch. 36)

Illo quidem die comparentem multitudinem peremere Romani. postea vero secutis diebus scrutando latebras, per cuniculos et speluncas in omnem saeviebant aetatem, praeter infantes ac foeminas. Itaque captivi quidem mille ducenti congregati erant: quadraginta vero millia connumerata sunt excidii tempore et pugnis superioribus mortuorum. At Vespasianus civitatem ipsam exscindi iubet, castellaque eius omnia exurit. Iotapata quidem ita devicta est tertiodecimo imperii Neronis anno, calendarum Juliarum die.
