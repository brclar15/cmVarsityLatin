# Ch. 23 - English


But still Josephus and those with him, although they fell down dead one upon another by the darts and stones which the engines threw upon them, yet did not they desert the wall, but fell upon those who managed the ram, under the protection of the hurdles, with fire, and iron weapons, and stones; and these could do little or nothing, but fell themselves perpetually, while they were seen by those whom they could not see, for the light of their own flame shone about them, and made them a most visible mark to the enemy, as they were in the day time, while the engines could not be seen at a great distance, and so what was thrown at them was hard to be avoided; for the force with which these engines threw stones and darts made them hurt several at a time, and the violent noise of the stones that were cast by the engines was so great, that they carried away the pinnacles of the wall, and broke off the corners of the towers; for no body of men could be so strong as not to be overthrown to the last rank by the largeness of the stones. 

# Title (Ch. 23 continued in Latin)
Sciet autem aliquis, huius machinae vis quantum valeat, ex his quae illa nocte contigerunt. in muro cuidam ex circunstantibus Josepho, saxo percusso caput avulsum est, eiusque ad tertium stadium veluti funda excussa calvaria. Interdiu quoque praegnantis foeminae transiecto utero, ad dimidium stadium infans abactus est : tanta tormento vis fuit. Ergo machinis terribilior erat impetus, et missilium strepitus. Crebri autem mortui, cum per muros deiicerentur, sonabant. et acerbissimus quidem intus excitabatur mulierum clamor: extrinsecus autem occumbentium gemitus concrepabant: totusque ambitus muri, ad quem pugnabatur, sanguine confluebat : iamque ascendi poterat congestione cadaverum. montes autem resonantes multo amplius horrorem augebant: nec quicquam illi nocti defuit, quod vel auribus vel oculis terrorem posset incutere. Plurimi quidem pro Jotapata decertantes, fortiter ceciderunt, plurimi etiam sauciati sunt, et tamen vix circa matutinas vigilias murus assiduis machinarum ictibus cessit. Tumque illi quidem corporibus atque armis eam partem, quae deiecta fuerat, priusquam Romani pontes apponerent, munierunt.
