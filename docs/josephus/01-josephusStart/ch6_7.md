# Ch. 6

# Title

6. Nihiloque minus, Romanis postridie iterum irruentibus occurrunt multoque fortius restiterunt ; ex eo scilicet fiduciam nacti, quod eos pridie praeter spem sustinuerant. sed eos quoque pugnaciores experti sunt, quod eorum iracundiam pudor incenderat, vinci credentium, nisi cito vicissent. Itaque per dies quinque Romanis minime ab aggressione cessantibus, etiam Jotapatenorum excursus agebantur, murique fortius oppugnabantur. Et neque Judaei vires hostium formidabant, neque Romanos difficultas oppidi capiendi lassabat.

7eng. Now Jotapata is almost all of it built on a precipice, having on all the other sides of it every way valleys immensely deep and steep, insomuch that those who would look down would have their sight fail them before it reaches to the bottom. It is only to be come at on the north side, where the utmost part of the city is built on the mountain, as it ends obliquely at a plain. This mountain Josephus had encompassed with a wall when he fortified the city, that its top might not be capable of being seized upon by the enemies. The city is covered all round with other mountains, and can no way be seen till a man comes just upon it. And this was the strong situation of Jotapata.
