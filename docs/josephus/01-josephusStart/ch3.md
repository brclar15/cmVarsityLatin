# Ch. 3

# Romans Approach

Vespasianus[^1] autem Jotapatam[^2] excindere cupiens (nam[^3] in eam plurimos hostium refugisse[^4] cognoverat, et praeterea validissimum hoc eorum esse receptaculum[^5]) praemittit pedites cum equitibus qui[^6] montanum iter coaequarent, saxis[^7] asperum, ac peditibus quoque difficile, omnino[^8] vero equitibus invium. Et hi quidem quatriduo fecere[^9] quod[^10] iussum est, latamque aperuere[^11] exercitui viam. Quinto autem die, qui mensis[^12] Maii vigesimus et primus erat, prior Josephus[^13] in Jotapatam ex Tiberiade[^14] venit, abiectosque[^15] Judaeorum spiritus erigit. Cum vero transitum[^16] eius Vespasiano quidam transfuga nunciasset, utque[^17] mox civitatem peteret incitaret, veluti[^18] cum ea totam Judaeam capere posset, si Josephum subiugasset, hoc[^19] ille nuncio pro maxima felicitate percepto, Dei[^20] providentia factum ratus, ut qui hostium prudentissimus videretur[^21], ultro[^22] se etiam in custodiam traderet voluntariam, statim[^23] quidem cum equitibus mille Placidum[^24] mittit, unaque decadarcham[^25] Ebutium, tam[^26] manu quam[^26] prudentia virum insignem, circumvallare civitatem iussit, ne[^27] clam inde Josephus elaberetur.


[^1]: *Vespasianus*: [Vespasian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vespasian) is the leading Roman general for the Jewish War. He later goes on to be emperor, ushering in the Flavian Dynasty, with his sons Titus and Domitian ruling after him

[^2]: *Jotapatam*: [Jotapata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yodfat), modern day Yodfat, was a keyJewish fortified city where the Roman began the first Jewish War in 67 AD

[^3]: *Nam in eam ….. esse receptaculum:* *cognoverat* starts off **indirect statement**, which runs for the entire phrase within the parentheses

[^4]: *Refugisse*: **perfect infinitive**, to have fled back, but remember to translate it within the **indirect statement** 

[^5]: *Receptaculum:* this refers to a place of refuge, because it is the most fortified town in the nearby area

[^6]: *qui montanum iter coaequarent*: **relative clause of purpose**, noted by the **subjunctive verb** *coaequarent. He sent ahead foot soldiers who would make level the mountain road* or, to take it another way, ***so that** they would make level the mountain road*

[^7]: *saxis asperum, ac peditibus quoque difficile*: both adjectival phrases describe the neuter *iter* in the previous clause

[^8]: *omnino vero equitibus invium*: this phrase describes the *iter* as well

[^9]: *fecere*: another **fake infinitive**

[^10]: *quod iussum est*: take this as the direct object of *fecere*

[^11]: *Aperuere:* this is a **fake infinitive**, where the \-*ere* replaces the \-*erunt* ending of the 3rd person, plural, perfect. *They have opened up….*

[^12]: *mensis Maii vigesimus et primus:* 21st of May, the starting date of the siege

[^13]: *Josephus*: following the tradition of Caesar in his *De bello Gallico,* and  *De bello civile,* Josephus refers to himself in the 3rd person throughout this work

[^14]: *Tiberiade*: [Tiberias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiberias), a major city founded by Herod Antipas and named in honor of Emperor Tiberias in 20 AD

[^15]: *abiectosque Judaeorum spiritus erigit*: *spiritus*, \-*us* (m) is **4th declension,** so take it as accusative plural here

[^16]: *transitum eius: Eius* refers to Josephus entering Jotapata 

[^17]: *utque mox civitatem peteret incitaret*: start with the *incitaret*, then the *ut mox civitatem peteret*

[^18]: *veluti cum ea ..... Josephum subiugasset*: the *ea* refers to the city of Jotapata. If Vespasian can take this city, he feels like he’ll have all of Judea under control

[^19]: *hoc ille nuncio pro maxima felicitate percepto:* take this whole thing, without the *ille*, as an **ablative absolute.** Connect the *ille* to the *ratus* later on

[^20]: *Dei providentia factum ratus: ratus* describes *ille* (Vespasian) and starts off **indirect statement**

[^21]: *Videretur: video* in the passive can also be *seem*  
   
[^22]: *ultro se etiam in custodiam traderet voluntariam*: *ultro* and *voluntariam* appear to have the same meaning in the phrase  
   
[^23]: *statim quidem….iussit*: jump to *mittit* for your main verb of this sentence  
   
[^24]: *Placidum*: Placidus is a high-ranking commander under Vespasian mentioned a few times in *De bello Iudaico*  
   
[^25]: *decadarcham Ebutium:* a *decadarcha,* or a decurion, was a Roman cavalry commander. Ebutius is not otherwise known outside of this passage 
   
[^26]: *tam manu quam prudentia virum insignem*:  *a man distinguished as much by his deeds (**tam manu**) as by his prudence/judgement (**quam prudentia**). Tam….quam* is *as much…..as…..*  Both *manu* and *prudentia* are **ablative of cause/respect**
   
[^27]: *ne clam inde Josephus elaberetur:*  **negative purpose clause**
