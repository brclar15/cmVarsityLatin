# Ch. 9

# Title

Tunc igitur Vespasianus machinis missilium circumpositis (erant autem omnes centum sexaginta) in eos qui super murum astarent, iussit tela contendi : simulque ex catapultis lanceae percurrebant, saxaque tormentis ingentia mittebantur, ignisque et sagittarum frequentissima multitudo, quae non solum murum, sed etiam totum intra iactum earum spatium Judaeis inaccessum fecere : Arabum enim sagittariorum manus, et iaculatores, itemque funditores et omnes machinae tela iaciebant. Neque tamen his Judaei prohibiti, ne desuper propugnarent, quieti erant : sed excurrendo per cuneos more latronum, tegmina operantium detrahebant, nudatosque feriebant : et ubi illi cessissent, aggerem dissipabant, vallorumque munimenta cum cratibus igni tradebant : donec Vespasianus cognito, huius damni causam ex distributione operum contigisse, quod interiecta spacia Judaei locum aggrediendi praeberent, adunavit tegmina : coniunctisque pariter viribus obreptiones hostium praepeditae sunt.

And when the bank was now raised, and brought nearer than ever to the battlements that belonged to the walls, Josephus thought it would be entirely wrong of him if he could make no counter-attack in opposition to theirs, and that might be for the city's preservation; so he got together his workmen, and ordered them to build the wall higher; and while they said that this was impossible to be done while so many darts were thrown at them, he invented this sort of cover for them: He bid them fix piles, and expand before them the raw hides of oxen newly killed, that these hides by yielding and hollowing themselves when the stones were thrown at them might receive them, for that the other darts would slide off them, and the fire that was thrown would be quenched by the moisture that was in them. And these he set before the workmen, and under them these workmen went on with their works in safety, and raised the wall higher, and that both by day and by night, fill it was twenty cubits high. He also built a good number of towers upon the wall, and fitted it to strong battlements. This greatly discouraged the Romans, who in their own opinions were already gotten within the walls, while they were now at once astonished at Josephus's cunning ploy, and at the fortitude of the citizens that were in the city.

# Ch. 11 in English

And now Vespasian was plainly irritated at the great subtlety of this stratagem, and at the boldness of the citizens of Jotapata; for taking heart again upon the building of this wall, they made fresh sallies upon the Romans, and had every day conflicts with them by parties, together with all such tricks, as robbers make use of, and with the plundering of all that came to hand, as also with the setting fire to all the other works; and this till Vespasian made his army leave off fighting them, and resolved to lie round the city, and to starve them into a surrender, as supposing that either they would be forced to petition him for mercy by want of provisions, or if they should have the courage to hold out till the last, they should perish by famine: and he concluded he should conquer them the more easily in fighting, if he gave them an interval, and then fell upon them when they were weakened by famine; but still he gave orders that they should guard against their coming out of the city.
