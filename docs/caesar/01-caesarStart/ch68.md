Fugato[^1] omni equitatu Vercingetorix[^1] copias[^1], ut[^1] pro castris collocaverat, reduxit protinusque Alesiam[^1], quod[^1] est oppidum Mandubiorum, iter[^1] facere coepit celeriterque impedimenta[^1] ex castris educi[^1] et se[^1] subsequi iussit. 2 Caesar impedimentis[^1] in proximum collem deductis, duabus[^1] legionibus praesidio relictis, secutus[^1] quantum diei tempus est[^1] passum, circiter[^1] tribus milibus hostium ex[^1] novissimo agmine interfectis altero die ad Alesiam castra fecit. 3 Perspecto[^1] urbis situ perterritisque hostibus, quod[^1] equitatu[^1], qua[^1] maxime parte exercitus confidebant, erant pulsi, adhortatus[^1] ad laborem milites circumvallare instituit.


[^1]: Fugato omni equitatu: Fugo, fugare, fugavi, fugatus means “to put to flight,” NOT fugio, fugere, which means “to flee.” Caesar is (usually) quite friendly with putting his ablative absolutes towards the front of his sentences/clauses

[^1]: Vercingetorix: Vercingetorix, the leader of the Averni (a powerful Gallic tribe). He has been chosen to lead the Gallic confederation against Caesar and the Romans, hoping to oust them permanently from Gaul.

[^1]: Copias: copiae can be “supplies” (usually when singular) or “troops” (usually when plural). Use context clues to figure it out. Take this as your direct object of reduxit later on

[^1]: ut pro castris collocaverat: ut + indicative is going to be as, compared to ut + subjunctive for a purpose/result/etc clause

[^1]: Alesiam: Alesia is a major oppidum, fortified town, of the Mandubii, a Gallic tribe in central-eastern Gaul

[^1]: quod est oppidum Mandubiorum: remember that while we love a quod = because, there is also quod = which

[^1]: iter facere: literally “to make a journey,” you can go with travel too

[^1]: impedimenta ex castris educi et se subsequi iussit: iubeo, ibuere, iussi, iussus takes an ACC + infinitive. Impedeimenta means “baggage,” the armor and supplies that soldiers carry with them as they march.

[^1]: Educi: this is a passive infinitive, to be verb-ed. You can recognize them by the final -i
        	(-are → -ari;    -ēre  →  -eri;    -ere  →  -i;    -ire  →  -iri)

[^1]: se subsequi: subsequi is a deponent infinitive, so it stays active, to follow. Se here is accusative direct object, NOT accusative subject

[^1]: impedimentis in ….. praesidio relictis: you have two ablative absolutes here, in spite of having Caesar in the nominative in front of them. Find a conjugated main verb that he is the subject of

[^1]: duabus legionibus praesidio relictis: praesidio is dative of purpose here, having been left behind as protection (for the purpose of protection)

[^1]: secutus: agrees with Caesar above, having followed. Deponent PPP of sequor

[^1]: est passum: passum is the PPP of patior meaning “to allow, permit, suffer.” A deponent PPP (with or without a form of sum) stays active, the time of the day has allowed

[^1]: circiter tribus …. interfectis: another ablative absolute!

[^1]: ex novissimo agmine: from the furthest battle line, novus, -a, -um can be “new, young, most recent”, etc

[^1]: Perspecto urbis situ perterritisque hostibus: you absolutely know what’s going on here!

[^1]: Quod: explaining why the enemies were scared

[^1]: Equitatu …. erant pulsi: they had been driven off from their horsemen, talking about the best part of their army being beaten back from the bulk of their forces. Equitatu is ablative of separation

[^1]: qua maxime parte exercitus: qua parte is on which part. Remember that exercitus is 4th declension, so most of the endings are -us. This is genitive singular here, on which part of the army

[^1]: adhortatus: again, this nominative PPP goes back to Caesar, our only nominative, masculine, singular noun
