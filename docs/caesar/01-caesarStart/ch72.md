## Title 

Quibus[^1] rebus cognitis ex perfugis et captivis, Caesar haec[^2] genera munitionis instituit. Fossam pedum viginti directis[^3] lateribus duxit, ut[^4] eius fossae solum[^5] tantundem[^6] pateret quantum[^6] summae fossae labra distarent. 2 Reliquas omnes munitiones ab ea fossa pedes quadringentos reduxit, [id][^7] hoc[^8] consilio, quoniam[^9] tantum esset necessario spatium complexus, nec facile[^10] totum corpus corona militum cingeretur, ne de[^11] improviso aut[^12] noctu ad munitiones hostium multitudo advolaret aut[^12] interdiu tela in[^13] nostros operi destinatos conicere possent. 3 Hoc[^14] intermisso spatio duas fossas quindecim pedes latas, eadem altitudine perduxit, quarum interiorem[^15] campestribus[^16] ac demissis locis aqua[^17] ex flumine derivata complevit. 4 Post eas aggerem[^18] ac vallum[^18] duodecim pedum exstruxit. Huic[^19] loricam[^20] pinnasque[^20] adiecit grandibus[^21] cervis eminentibus ad commissuras pluteorum[^22] atque aggeris, qui[^23] ascensum hostium tardarent, et turres toto opere circumdedit, quae pedes LXXX inter se distarent.


[^1]: *Quibus rebus….. captivis*: I absolutely should not need to point this out anymore

[^2]: *haec genera munitionis*: *genus, generis* (n) can have a lot of different meanings. Here, you want “kind/type,” since he’s going to list the different siege fortifications

[^3]: *directis lateribus*: **ablative of description**, *with vertical sides*

[^4]: *ut …..labra distarent*: this is a **result clause**, though there’s not really an intensifier word to trigger it. *With the result that the bottom of this trench stood open (was wide) just as much as the edge of the top of the trench stood apart.* (meaning that the width at the bottom was the same width as at the top.)

[^5]: *solum*: *solum, soli* (n) – bottom, ground. NOT *sol, solis* (m) – sun NOR *solus, \-a, \-um* – alone, only

[^6]: *tantundem*….*quantum*: just as much as….

[^7]:  \[*id*\]: words in brackets in Latin/Greek texts show that a modern editor thought the word(s) did not belong in the original text, but did not feel confident enough to remove it. If you saw a word in \<pointy brackets,\> this means the opposite, that they thought the word(s) should be inserted

[^8]: \[*id*\] *hoc consilio*: supply a *fecit*, I’d imagine. *\[He did\] it with this plan*

[^9]: *quoniam ….. complexus*: *since there was by necessity such a space of surrounding.* Take *complexus* as genitive here

[^10]: *facile totum …. cingeretur*: take *totum corpus* as your subject, referring to the body of siege crafts. *Corona* is ablative of means

[^11]: *de improviso*: *unexpectedly, without warning*

[^12]: *aut….aut*: (n)either….(n)or

[^13]: *in nostros operi destinatos*: *against our* (troops) *having been engaged in the work* (building of siege crafts)

[^14]: *Hoc intermisso spatio*: *behind this open space*

[^15]: *Interiorem*: *interiorem fossam*, the trench nearer to the town

[^16]: *campestribus ac demissis locis*: *from level (campestribus*) *or low-lying (*demissis*) places*

[^17]: *aqua:* **ablative of means** with *complevit*, *filled it with water*

[^18]: *aggerem ac vallum*: an [*agger*](http://roma.andreapollett.com/S4/walls.htm) (Control+F “*agger*” on the link) is a mud-ramp wall used to make the ground level with the top of the enemy wall. A *vallum* is translated as [palisades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palisade), which is a row of stakes erected as a defensive wall

[^19]: *huic*: *to this*, dative singular

[^20]: *loricam pinnasque*: [lorica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breastwork_\(fortification\)) is a breastwork, a mound/wall thrown up about the height of a man’s chest. *Pinnae* are [parapets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parapet), an area where the wall extends at the top of a structure, where someone could stand to look down at the enemy and/or fire upon them

[^21]: *grandibus cervis eminentibus*: A lot of Roman military terms take their names from animals (*testudo, musculus*, *corvus*, etc), like the *cervus*, which ordinarily means “stag/elk.” This refers to a [cheval de frise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheval_de_frise) (Frisian Horse, in French), which are defensive spikey (much like the antlers of an elk) obstacles meant to slow down an enemy charge

[^22]: *pluteorum*: WOW this is a lot of siege vocab. A *pluteus* is a covering made of wicker that is usually used to protect men as they’re building these siege engines, but can also be used to provide extra defense and cover

[^23]: *qui ascensum hostium tardarent*: the **subjunctive** verb (*tardarent*) within this relative clause makes this either a **relative clause of characteristic** or, as it is here, a **relative clause of purpose.** The junctions of the shields and agger were meant to slow down the ascent of the enemy, so that’s where we get the purpose-y nature of this phrase
