## Title 

Opere[^1] instituto fit[^2] equestre[^3] proelium in ea planitie, quam[^4] intermissam collibus tria milia passuum in longitudinem patere supra demonstravimus[^5]. Summa[^6] vi ab utrisque contenditur[^7]. 2 Laborantibus nostris Caesar Germanos[^8] summittit legionesque pro castris constituit, ne[^9] qua subito irruptio ab hostium peditatu fiat. 3 Praesidio legionum addito nostris[^10] animus augetur: hostes in fugam coniecti[^11] se[^12] ipsi multitudine impediunt atque angustioribus[^13] portis relictis coacervantur. 4 Germani acrius[^14] usque ad munitiones sequuntur. 5 Fit magna caedes[^15]: nonnulli[^16] relictis equis fossam transire et maceriam transcendere conantur. Paulum[^17] legiones Caesar quas pro[^18] vallo constituerat promoveri[^19] iubet. 6 Non minus qui intra munitiones erant perturbantur Galli: veniri[^20] ad se confestim existimantes ad arma conclamant; nonnulli perterriti in oppidum irrumpunt. 7 Vercingetorix iubet portas claudi, ne[^21] castra nudentur. Multis interfectis, compluribus equis captis Germani sese[^22] recipiunt.


[^1]: *Opere instituto*: *opus, operis* (n) is usually going to be “fortifications” in our readings, rather than “work”

[^2]: *Fit*: *it happens*

[^3]: *equestre proelium*: 3rd declension adjectives will end in an -*e* when describing a word that is neuter nominative/accusative singular

[^4]: *quam intermissam collibus*: *[the plain] having been set (among) hills*

[^5]: *quam intermissam …. demonstravimus*: the *demonstravimus* starts off **indirect statement**, with *patere* as your **infinitive** and *quam*, referring to the *planitie*, as the **accusative subject**.

[^6]: *Summa vi ab utrisque*: *summa vi* is **ablative of means/manner,** *with the greatest force*. *Ab utrisque* is *by both sides*, the -*que* sometimes gets attached to *uter* and similar words, don’t stress about it.

[^7]: *Contenditur*: this is an **impersonal passive**, literally “it is contended (ab urtisque) by both sides.” It is more natural in English to make it active, “both sides contended….” This construction is fairly common in Latin, and in Caesar especially

[^8]: *Germanos*: while the Germans are usually enemies of Rome, Caesar has enlisted the aid of German mercenaries, due to their skill in war, particularly when fighting against the Gauls

[^9]: *ne qua …. peditatu fiat*: again, the *qua* is short for *aliqua* after the *ne*, and goes with the *irruptio*, *so that any sally/charge….*

[^10]: *nostris animus augetur*: *nostris* is a **dative of interest** here, _the spirit is increasing **for our guys**_. You can make it a **dative of possession** too, _**our** spirit is increasing_

[^11]: *coniecti*: this nominative plural **PPP** describes the *hostes*

[^12]: *se ipsi multitudine impediunt*: the reflexive (*se*) and intensive (*ipsi*) can be confusing/redundant here. *They (ipsi) impede themselves (se) because of the crowd (multitudine)*. Caesar is stressing that the Gauls are causing their own struggles here

[^13]: *angustioribus portis relictis*: make sure to notice the **comparative** in _angust**ior**ibus_, *by the more/rather narrow remaining gates*

[^14]: *acrius*: the -*ius* is often the ending for a **comparative adverb**, such as “more quickly, more fiercely, more slowly, etc,” *more sharply*

[^15]: *caedes*: *caedis, -is* (f) – slaughter, bloodshed

[^16]: *nonnulli*: *non*+*nullus* = “not no one,” meaning “some, someone”  *sigh…..*

[^17]: *Paulum*: take this as an **adverbial accusative**, *a little*. This can happen with adjectives in the neuter, accusative, singular

[^18]: *pro vallo*: a **vallum** is a defensive wall

[^19]: *promoveri*: recognize this as a **passive infinitive**

[^20]: *veniri …. existimantes*: *existimantes* describes the *Galli*, and starts off **indirect statement**. *Veniri* is a **passive infinitive**, meaning “it is arrived,” which is better changed to “they (the Romans) came”

[^21]: *ne castra nudentur*: *so that the camps not be left empty/unprotected*

[^22]: *sese recipiunt*: *se recipere* = “to retreat”, though not always in a defeated way, as seen here
