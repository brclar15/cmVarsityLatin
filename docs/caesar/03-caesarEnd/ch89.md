## Title 

Postero die Vercingetorix concilio convocato id bellum se suscepisse non suarum necessitatium, 2 sed communis libertatis causa[^1] demonstrat[^2], et quoniam[^3] sit fortunae cedendum, ad[^4] utramque rem se[^5] illis offerre, seu[^6] morte sua Romanis satisfacere seu[^6] vivum[^7] tradere velint[^8]. Mittuntur de his rebus ad Caesarem legati[^9]. 3 Iubet[^10] arma tradi, principes produci. 4 Ipse in munitione pro castris consedit: eo[^11] duces producuntur; Vercingetorix deditur, arma proiciuntur. 5 Reservatis Aeduis[^12] atque Arvernis, si[^13] per eos civitates reciperare posset, ex reliquis captivis toto exercitui capita[^14] singula praedae[^15] nomine distribuit.


[^1]: *suarum necessitatium, communis libertatis*: both of these sets of genitives are connected to the *causa*, which is in the ablative, making it an **ablative of cause**

[^2]: *demonstrat*: jump to this as your main verb, after the **ablative absolute,** of course, and then work back to the rest of the sentence, which is in **indirect statement**


[^3]: *quoniam sit fortunae cedendum*: *sit* is subjunctive of *sum*. Take this with the *cedendum,* as your **passive periphrastic** (FPP \+ form of *sum*). *fortunae* is dative, following *cedendum*

[^4]: *ad utramque rem*: connect this with the *offerre* later on

[^5]: *se illis offerre*: this continues the **indirect statement** started by *demonstrat*

[^6]: *seu….seu*: *either if……or if….*

[^7]: *Vivum*: supply a “him” with this

[^8]: *Velint*: this is **subjunctive** of *volo*. It’s subjunctive because it’s a subordinate clause in indirect statement (not the most important thing to remember, so don’t stress over it)

[^9]: *Legati*: here the *legati* clearly refers to envoys from the Gauls

[^10]: *Iubet*: Caesar is the subject of this verb

[^11]: *Eo*: *there* or *to this (spot)*, **ablative of location**

[^12]: *Aeduis atque Arvernis*: both of the [Aedui](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aedui) and the [Averni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arverni) (the tribe that Vercingetorix belonged to) are prominent tribes among the Gauls

[^13]: *si per eos civitates reciperare posset*: here, Caesar is telling the reader why these tribes in particular are spared

[^14]: *capita singula*: literally *one head each*, here meaning *one person each*

[^15]: *praedae nomine*: *in the name of booty/loot*. It was common for Romans to take prisoners of war as slaves upon conquering a people
